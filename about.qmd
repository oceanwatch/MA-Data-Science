Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), NOAA/JIMAR, Honolulu, HI \
(contractor to the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration, through the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research of the University of Hawaii)

Duties:

-   Manage a website that delivers ocean remote sensing data to a variety of users (scientists, federal and state resource managers, fishermen, educators, general public)

-   Understand and fulfill needs and requirements of each type of users

-   Maintain data streams, metadata, data platforms

-   Maintain Unix servers (CentOS6)

-   Keep up with development and launch of new satellites, sensors, data products, and data platforms

-   Ensure data compliance with federal requirements for Public Access to Research Results (PARR)

-   Manage project tasks and budgets independently Supervise and manage up to 8 staff across various projects (develop work plans, conduct performance evaluations, conduct recruitments, manage workloads and deadlines)

    **2014-2015: Ecosystem Researcher, PIFSC, Honolulu, HI**

    Duties:

-   Lead a research project on habitat modeling for two species of cetaceans around the Hawaiian Islands

-   Integrated and synthesized data from various external partners (satellite tracking, ocean remote sensing, ocean general circulation model, diet and active acoustics data) into an ecospatial model to quantify habitat preference for each species

-   Published results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal

-   Successfully applied for external funding (\$159k) to fund project

    **2008 -- 2014: Research Analyst, PIFSC, Honolulu, HI**

    Duties: Worked on a variety of research projects, including:

-   Modeled spatial and temporal population dynamics of swordfish in the Pacific Ocean using satellite tracking data, fisheries data and the SEAPODYM model developed by Lehodey et al, 2008

-   Modeled loggerhead turtles habitat and movements, using satellite tracking data and ocean remote sensing data

-   Analyzed interactions and overlap between loggerhead turtles and the Hawaii- based longline fishery targeting swordfish to evaluate strategies to reduce bycatch

-   Studied changes in catch composition of the Hawaii-based longline fishery using logbook and observers data

-   Participated in research cruises

-   Published results in peer-reviewed scientific journals

    **2007-2008: Research Assistant, PIFSC, Honolulu, HI**

    Duties: Worked on a variety of research projects, including:
